VERSION or DATE: 11/6/18
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Recommended to use BlueJ IDE
AUTHORS: Dan Sedano & Prof. Anthony Smith Phd
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Open project on BlueJ using the package.blueJ file.
Note: Prof. Smith Wrote the Tester Class to test my code.

Grade: 10/10

Feedback:

Hello Professor Smith, How efficient would you say this code is, and how can I improve? Thank you for your help!

Good work, full credit -- keep doing what you have been doing, this work is good enough for your stage of programming development.
You will continue to improve as you take more classes.

I've checked your Card, Hand and CountRank classes plus output, looks like you had no problems:

-output is correct. (BTW, that the special suit characters may not display correctly in the .txt output file is due to the character sets and text editor programs being used,
  is nothing to worry about.)

-required constants, instance variables, constructor and methods present in your classes

-good validation in Hand class ctor() that hand does not contain duplicate cards

-good Javadoc method comments, clear code layout

-you are successfully able to design and write many complex methods, working with arrays and array list objects in many classes

Some general points:

-I grade for correct, simple, clear - so make sure that the output of your program is correct, and that the program is as easy to understand as possible, for a maintenance programmer

You can keep track in Canvas of how you're doing, under Grades. Well done.
